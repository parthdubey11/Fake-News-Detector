# Fake-News-Detector
ðŸ“„ Project Description:
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. It utilizes the TF-IDF vectorization method to convert raw news text into numerical features and then applies multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict whether a given news article is "Fake" or "Not Fake".

The system allows for real-time manual testing where users can input any news headline or article, and it returns predictions from all models for comparison.
